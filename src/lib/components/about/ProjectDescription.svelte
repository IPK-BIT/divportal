<h1 class="text-2xl">Project Description</h1>
<p class="text-justify">
	The SHAPE-P3 project is an interdisciplinary continued effort to discover the complexity of
	structural variation and to estimate the dimension of the core- and pan-genome and the
	pan-plastome of barley. This information will provide the basis for establishing new approaches
	underpinning innovative strategies in genomics-based barley breeding and exploration of natural
	genetic resources for crop improvement. The project will build extensively on previous work of the
	cooperation partners (SHAPEP1, SHAPE-P2) and extend previously established barley genomic
	resources to unlock the complex genomic diversity and structural variation of barley for
	innovative and sustainable barley breeding. By the direct interaction with four leading barley
	breeding companies in Germany and Europe we will demonstrate the power and potential of the
	generated high density and high resolution genomic variation matrix for application in genome wide
	association (GWAS) mapping and showcase how this information can be exploited for better informed
	selection of diverse and compatible haplotypes represented in natural genetic resource collections
	for predictable increase of genetic diversity and thus enforcing of breeding programs.

	To chart genomic diversity and small / large scale structural variation and to estimate the core-
	and pan-genomes of barley, in conjunction with the international barley pan-genome consortium,
	SHAPE has generated over 70 high-quality genome assemblies until the end of project phase 2. Due
	to the way the germplasm was selected to represent the barley pan-genome, the unraveled level of
	diversity is overwhelming to practical plant breeders, thus there is an urgent need to establish a
	further bridging pan-genome data resource. SHAPE-P3 will work towards the following goals:
</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside p-4">
	<li>
		20 elite barley varieties, either founder or key pedigree genotypes will be sequenced and
		assembled to equivalent quality in order to establish the practical haplotype matrix represented
		in European barley breeding programs.
	</li>
	<li>
		All 70 pan-genome assemblies and the additional genomes of 20 varieties will be fully annotated.
	</li>
	<li>
		All data will be integrated into a pan-genome graph and visualized based on different user
		preferences (breeder, researcher).
	</li>
	<li>
		Cytoplasm exchange material established in SHAPE-P2 to exploit agronomic potential of diverse
		nuclear genome/cytoplasm combinations will be evaluated under field conditions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Genetic mapping of novel disease resistance resources will be performed in DH populations
		established in P2 by SHAPE industry partners.
	</li>
	<li>
		Pan-genome informed genomic prediction for disease resistance will be established by developing
		trait-customized diversity collections in barley.
	</li>
</ol>
<p class="text-justify">
	The SHAPE-P3 project consistently extends the research of the preceding project phases and thus
	represents the logical next step to make barley pan-genome information broadly accessible and
	exploitable to research and breeding, hence to underpin sustainable crop improvement in barley. An
	interdisciplinary research team of plant geneticists, genomicists, computational biologist,
	statisticians, and four leading German barley breeding companies will work closely and efficiently
	together at the interface of barley basic genome research and advanced breeding practices. The
	project will uncover the potential and impact of using SV/CNV information for precision barley
	breeding.
